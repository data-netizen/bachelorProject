# NLP Analysis of Political Discourse on Greece's 2021 Labor Bill: A Data Journalism Approach
This is my bachelor's project in data journalism for the Department of Communication and Media Studies at the Kapodistrian University of Athens. 
The main aim of this project is to examine the political discourse on the labor bill which was voted on in 2021 in Greece and as expressed by political actors on Twitter and on news websites with different political views.
